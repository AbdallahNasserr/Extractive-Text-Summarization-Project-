# 📝 Extractive Text Summarization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **Extractive Text Summarization**, a technique that selects key sentences from a document to generate a concise summary while preserving the original context. The approach is particularly useful for summarizing news articles, research papers, and long-form content.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop an efficient summarization model using extractive methods.  
- Utilize **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for sentence ranking.  
- Improve readability and maintain essential information in the generated summaries.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text preprocessing  
- **SpaCy** for advanced linguistic processing  
- **Scikit-learn** for feature extraction and sentence scoring  
- **NetworkX** for graph-based sentence ranking (e.g., TextRank algorithm)  


## 🏗️ Methodology  
1. **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.  
2. **Sentence Representation** – Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings.  
3. **Sentence Ranking** – Graph-based ranking (TextRank) or statistical scoring.  
4. **Summary Generation** – Selecting top-ranked sentences to form the final summary.
